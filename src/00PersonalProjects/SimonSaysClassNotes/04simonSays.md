## Simon Says 

Build a Simon Says game. It could look similar to image simon.jpg, but it can look however you want:
   - Create a start button that the user can click to start the game
   - Each button is a certain color
   - When the game starts, pick a button at random that lights up its color for 1-2 seconds
   - If the user clicks that button, the game repeats that button and then adds another
   - This keeps going for 5 cycles (or whatever number you'd like), or until the player picks a wrong button
      - example: red, red-blue, red-blue-green, red-blue-green-yellow, red-blue-green-yellow-green
   - Display a victory screen/alert after the player successfully completes 5 cycles
   - Display a defeat screen/alert if the player clicks a wrong button
