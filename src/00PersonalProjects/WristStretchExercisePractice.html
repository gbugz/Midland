<!--This is a test project-->
<!--The goal is to make an on-click event handler that responds to a button-->
<!--The button then starts a timer that will cycle through images of my wrist stretching routine-->
<!--Images will hold for 20 seconds, then have a five second fade between-->
<!--Upon completion, I'll have an input pop-up that will record how my hands feel today-->
<!--The console will then log how my hands feel-->
<!--Maybe I could even get this to run on a server?-->
