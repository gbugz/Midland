// Logic Practice

// 1. Positive or Negative
// Create a program that checks if a number stored in a variable is positive or negative. 
// Log "The number is positive" if it's greater than zero, otherwise log "The number is negative."

// 2. Minimum Age for Driving
// Write a program that checks a person's age stored in a variable and logs "Can drive" if they are 16 or older. 
// If they are under 16, log "Cannot drive."

// 3. School Grade Levels
// Create a program that categorizes school levels based on a student's grade stored in a variable.
// Use the following categories: "Elementary" for grades 1-5, "Middle" for grades 6-8, and "High" for grades 9-12. 
// Log the school level.

// 4. Basic Discount System
// A shop offers a discount for purchases over $50. 
// Write a program where the total purchase amount is stored in a variable. 
// If the amount is over $50, calculate the discount and log it. Otherwise, log "No discount available."

// FIZZBUZZ

// Run through all the numbers from 1-100
// Log the number and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
// Log the number and "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
// Log the number and "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
// Log the number if none of the above conditions are true

// EXTRA: 

// Modify the FizzBuzz problem to allow the user to choose a max integer.
// (example: the user is prompted for a number, they choose 15, so the problem runs through the numbers 1 to 15)
